# AI-Flappy-Bird-Clone
A clone of hit mobile game Flappy Bird. With built in AI using NEAT library which develops a generation of birds that learn to play. My first introduction to AI, based off the tutorial by "Tech with Tim". Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHA-elMrxI&amp;t=2s  

This is my first attempt to make a project outside from my coursework, I was not sure in which direction to go, everything from finding a project to reading documentation was highly overwhelming. So I decided to follow a tutorial of a topic that always peaked my interests which is Artificial Intelligence. Following along the tutorial I was able to apply my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming learned from school to the process of making the game. There I revisited making several objects and ensuring that it works together as intended. Where I felt stumped was with obscure things I had no experience building before, like for example, the game's collision system, and implementing Artificial Intelligence, so I followed through until the end and genuinely learned alot and more importantly had fun. Although this project is unrepresentive of my skill of a Developer, this is my main starting off point and increased my spark to start making projects on my own, such as my first project "Discord-Weather-Bot".
